Hello Immanuel, Congratulations on completing the “Regex Tutorial” homework! 

To have this tutorial render as markdown you have to attach the .md file extension to the file name. 

Choosing the regex tutorial on matching an email address is a great choice. 

[X] Be sure to give this regex tutorial a unique name in regards to what the regex tutorial is about!

[X] It looks like your introductory paragraph is more of a summary. 

[X] I would change that to your summary and add a nice detailed introductory paragraph to draw the reader in to reading your tutorial! 

[X] I like that you made the table of contents have the linking capability to route to the specific section of the tutorial. 

[o] However, I was unable to assess its functionality since this gist did not render as markdown. 

[X] I like how you provided detailed information, examples, and code snippets in your sections. 

[o] Per the required criteria, you should give each different component of the regex its own individual section. 

[X] Thank you for including an “Author” section with information about yourself. 

[o] I was unable to check the functionality of the GitHub repo link due to this tutorial not rendering as markdown.

[o] I would suggest reading through carefully and fixing the grammar and spelling errors in some areas to allow your content to be understood as clearly as possible. 
 
[o] Some advice I could give you is that you should place all this content (not including the markdown syntax) in a word editor for its spelling and grammar suggestions. Strong effort Immanuel! Keep pushing forward and grow from here! I believe in you! Central Grader, AB Grade: 62
